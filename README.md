# Navy Administrative Automation Tool (NAAT)
The Naval Administrative Assistant Tool harnesses the capabilities of ChatGPT to streamline and assist U.S. Navy officers with critical administrative tasks, such as FITREPs, award write-ups, and letters of instruction (LOIs). By integrating AI technology, the tool aims to reduce manual workload, enhance documentation accuracy, and promote operational efficiency within the Navy's administrative processes.

### Description of Problem/Opportunity
The United States Navy, as one of the world's premier maritime forces, is renowned for its dedication to the mission and the rigorous training of its officers. Yet, the ever-present administrative responsibilities that accompany a Navy officer's role pose a substantial challenge. From handling leave and special requests to drafting CASREPs, managing qualifications, FITREPs, and award write-ups, the weight of these administrative tasks is undeniable.

These responsibilities, while essential to the functioning of the Navy, often come at a cost: priceless time. Each moment an officer spends navigating the intricate web of administrative duties is a moment diverted from honing their capabilities, strategizing, and focusing on the core mission. In an industry where time is critical, and every second can influence outcomes, the imbalance between administrative tasks and mission-centric activities becomes a palpable concern.

While paperwork and administrative functions serve as the backbone of organizational structure and discipline, they invariably detract from the time officers could dedicate to essential functions, training, and real-time mission activities. The question then becomes: how can the U.S. Navy reconcile the need for meticulous administration with the imperative of maximizing officers' time and focus on their primary duties?

### Proposed Solution/Approach
The challenges posed by the extensive administrative requirements in the Navy necessitate a modern, innovative solution. Leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT, we propose the development of the Naval Administrative Automation Tool (NAAT), a system designed to significantly reduce the administrative burden on naval officers.

**1. Data Gathering & Understanding:**
To begin, real-world examples of the administrative documents in question would be collected. This dataset would serve a dual purpose:
It would provide a comprehensive view of the existing document structures and essential components.
It would allow ChatGPT to understand the stylistic nuances and specific language nuances pertinent to Navy administration.

**2. Prompt Documentation Creation:**
With a solid understanding of the data:
- ChatGPT would iteratively assist in generating dynamic prompts for each type of document.
- These templates would capture the essence and structure of the documents while providing placeholders or fields for variable information.
- Naval officers can use these prompts to input specific details or data, and in response, the NAAT would generate a well-structured document that conforms to Navy standards and stylistics.

**4. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:**
One of the strengths of using an AI-powered solution is the ability to learn and adapt over time. As more officers use the system and as naval administrative requirements evolve:
- The system can be periodically trained on new data or feedback, ensuring it remains up-to-date and continues to meet the Navy's needs.

In essence, the proposed NAAT system, powered by ChatGPT, stands to revolutionize the way naval administrative tasks are approached, enabling officers to reclaim valuable time and focus more on their primary mission-critical duties.

## Goals of project 
**Due October 26, 11:59pm**

Describe 1-5 goals of the project. 
### Goal 1 - Documentation for prompt engineering
To maximize the efficiency and accuracy of NAAT's output, officers need clear guidance on interacting with ChatGPT. This goal emphasizes the creation of comprehensive documentation that details the specific context, information, and follow-up prompts officers should provide. Such guidance ensures consistent, accurate document generation while also aiding officers in navigating any potential nuances or intricacies of the tool.

### Goal 2 - Continuous user testing and feedback collection
A tool's effectiveness is only as good as its user satisfaction. For NAAT to be genuinely transformative, it needs to be tailored to the unique needs and preferences of naval officers. Regular user testing and feedback collection ensure that NAAT evolves in the right direction, meeting the demands of its primary audience.

### Goal 3 - Reduction in administrative time
The ultimate vision for NAAT is to free up naval officers from the often burdensome administrative tasks that divert their focus from mission-critical activities. By automating and optimizing these tasks, the tool aims to give officers more time to dedicate to their primary duties.

## Project Metrics 
**Due October 26, 11:59pm**

Compose 2-5 metrics to determine the success of the project. These should be measureable, and should translate to a letter grade for each. 
### Metric 1: Manual vs. NAAT Documentation Completion Time
A - NAAT produced a solution at least 25% faster than a manually completed solution
C - NAAT produced a solution in comparable time to manual completion
F - NAAT fails to produce a solution with unlimited time

### Metric 2: Manual vs. NAAT Documentation Reliability
A - NAAT produced a solution that is just as rigorous and reliable as manual completion
C - NAAT produced a solution that is passable, but not excellent quality-wise in comparison to a manually completed document
F - NAAT produced a solution that is defunct and insufficient compared to a manually completed document
