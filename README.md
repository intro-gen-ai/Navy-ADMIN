## Project Proposal 
### Description of Problem/Opportunity
The United States Navy, as one of the world's premier maritime forces, is renowned for its dedication to the mission and the rigorous training of its officers. Yet, the ever-present administrative responsibilities that accompany a Navy officer's role pose a substantial challenge. From handling leave and special requests to drafting CASREPs, managing qualifications, FITREPs, and award write-ups, the weight of these administrative tasks is undeniable.

These responsibilities, while essential to the functioning of the Navy, often come at a cost: priceless time. Each moment an officer spends navigating the intricate web of administrative duties is a moment diverted from honing their capabilities, strategizing, and focusing on the core mission. In an industry where time is critical, and every second can influence outcomes, the imbalance between administrative tasks and mission-centric activities becomes a palpable concern.

While paperwork and administrative functions serve as the backbone of organizational structure and discipline, they invariably detract from the time officers could dedicate to essential functions, training, and real-time mission activities. The question then becomes: how can the U.S. Navy reconcile the need for meticulous administration with the imperative of maximizing officers' time and focus on their primary duties?

### Proposed Solution/Approach
The challenges posed by the extensive administrative requirements in the Navy necessitate a modern, innovative solution. Leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT, we propose the development of the Naval Administrative Automation Tool (NAAT), a system designed to significantly reduce the administrative burden on naval officers.

**1. Data Gathering & Understanding:**
To begin, real-world examples of the administrative documents in question would be collected. This dataset would serve a dual purpose:
- It would provide a comprehensive view of the existing document structures and essential components.
- It would allow ChatGPT to understand the stylistic nuances and specific language nuances pertinent to Navy administration.

**2. Prompt Documentation Creation:**
With a solid understanding of the data:
- ChatGPT would iteratively assist in generating dynamic prompts for each type of document.
- These templates would capture the essence and structure of the documents while providing placeholders or fields for variable information.
- Naval officers can use these prompts to input specific details or data, and in response, the NAAT would generate a well-structured document that conforms to Navy standards and stylistics.

**3. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:**
One of the strengths of using an AI-powered solution is the ability to learn and adapt over time. As more officers use the system and as naval administrative requirements evolve:
- The system can be periodically trained on new data or feedback, ensuring it remains up-to-date and continues to meet the Navy's needs.

In essence, the proposed NAAT system, powered by ChatGPT, stands to revolutionize the way naval administrative tasks are approached, enabling officers to reclaim valuable time and focus more on their primary mission-critical duties.

## Goals of project 
### Goal 1 - Documentation for prompt engineering
To maximize the efficiency and accuracy of NAAT's output, officers need clear guidance on interacting with ChatGPT. This goal emphasizes the creation of comprehensive documentation that details the specific context, information, and follow-up prompts officers should provide. Such guidance ensures consistent, accurate document generation while also aiding officers in navigating any potential nuances or intricacies of the tool.

### Goal 2 - Continuous user testing and feedback collection
A tool's effectiveness is only as good as its user satisfaction. For NAAT to be genuinely transformative, it needs to be tailored to the unique needs and preferences of naval officers. Regular user testing and feedback collection ensure that NAAT evolves in the right direction, meeting the demands of its primary audience.

### Goal 3 - Reduction in administrative time
The ultimate vision for NAAT is to free up naval officers from the often burdensome administrative tasks that divert their focus from mission-critical activities. By automating and optimizing these tasks, the tool aims to give officers more time to dedicate to their primary duties.

## Project Metrics 
### Metric 1: Manual vs. NAAT Documentation Completion Time
A - NAAT produced a solution at least 25% faster than a manually completed solution \
C - NAAT produced a solution in comparable time to manual completion \
F - NAAT fails to produce a solution with unlimited time

### Metric 2: Manual vs. NAAT Documentation Reliability
A - NAAT produced a solution that is just as rigorous and reliable as manual completion \
C - NAAT produced a solution that is passable, but not excellent quality-wise in comparison to a manually completed document \
F - NAAT produced a solution that is defunct and insufficient compared to a manually completed document

## Self-Evaluation

#### Goal 1: Documentation for prompt engineering
Ultimately, I decided to move away from this goal with the introduction of Custom GPT's launching in early November. The progress I made in terms of prompt engineering was still productive, however. Working on fine-tuning the prompts early in this project instilled a strong foundation for the eventual testing of my custom GPT later on. My discoveries in the early phases of prompt engineering allowed for more targeted testing of the custom GPT.

#### Goal 2: Continuous user testing and feedback collection
This goal was met. After fine-tuning the custom Navy Administrative Assistant Tool GPT, I was able to routinely receive feedback from my class advisor in Naval ROTC, who is a nuclear qualified naval officer with almost 9 years of experience in the United States Navy. Additionally, I met with a former naval officer attending the Owen School of Management to receive feedback on the tool. Both of these men directly worked with NAM write-ups and FITREP comments routinely throughout their careers. They were able to provide real-world example prompts for me the test the GPT. Additionally, they both offered specific areas for improvement to make my solution more practical.

#### Goal 3/Metric 1: Reduction in administrative time
Goal 3 and metric 1 both involve the central function of NAAT -- to reduce the amount of time naval officers spend on administrative tasks. With testing performed by two officers, the feedback I received indicated this goal was met. "This reduces a 20 minute process into a 5 minutes process" was the most poignant example of feedback I received, indicating that NAAT effectively reduces time on NAM write-ups and FITREPs.

Address each of the goals, and assess each of the metrics. Include a statement on each on what you achieved or did not achieve, give support for your assessments.

#### Metric 4: Manual vs. NAAT Documentation Reliability
Even with weeks of continued testing and fine-tuning, the generated outputs of NAM write-ups and FITREP comments cannot be used without human interaction. This is mainly due to the limitations of ChatGPT, which will be discussed in further depth in the "Reflection on Learning" section below. The feedback I received on this tool is consistent -- NAAT is an effective middle-man for generating these documents, but human editing and revision is required before finalizing these write-ups. This was a result I anticipated at the beginning of this project.

## Reflection on Learning
500-1000 words
With this project being the culminating project of the semester, my generative artificial intelligence knowledge base has expanded vastly. One of the primary takeaways I've had throughout this process was the importance of prompt engineering. 

### Limitations
Originally, I envisioned the final product of the NAAT to focus on comprehensive prompt documentation for naval officers utilizing GPT 3.5/4 for FITREP and award write-up drafting. However, the project evolved with OpenAI's launch of Custom GPTs, offering a unique opportunity to explore the potential of this new technology.

Prior to this project, my understanding of AI, particularly generative AI, was limited. I had seen and experimented with ChatGPT prior, but in a limited capacity. At the time, perceived ChatGPT as a near-comprehensive solution, capable of significantly reducing human input after a single, well-crafted prompt. This project, however, was a practical foray into the realm of AI, challenging my preconceptions and broadening my understanding of its capabilities and limitations.

One of the first roadblocks encountered was the realization that GPT 4, despite its advanced nature, could not interact with editable PDFs. This limitation was a stark reminder that AI, no matter how sophisticated, is not omnipotent. My initial hope that GPT 4 could automatically input generated data into PDF forms was quickly tempered by the reality of its limitations.

Further challenges arose in the tool's adaptability. My intention to upload the entire Navy and Marine Corps Awards Manual (SECNAV M-1650.1) for comprehensive reference was ambitious. I believed that if I uploaded this reference document, this custom GPT would be able to produce an adequate write-up for each individual award, with their own respective write-up requirements. However, within the project's timeframe, satisfactory outputs were achieved only for the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (NAM), one of the more commonplace awards in the United States Navy. This highlighted another critical insight: generative AI's adaptability can be limited when trying to solve multiple unique problems with the same solutions..

The process of iteratively updating the configuration of Custom GPTs was another area of learning. While these updates allowed instructions to be provided to NAAT on the backend, they often overrode previous changes, resulting in a frustrating cycle of continuous adjustments. This experience underscored the necessity of human oversight and intervention in refining AI tools.

Moreover, the project brought to light the significant concern of privacy in AI applications. Even though NAM write-ups and FITREPs are unclassified, they are sensitive information, necessitating careful consideration of privacy and security in AI implementations.

Despite these challenges, the project immensely contributed to my understanding of generative AI. My skills in prompt engineering were honed, enabling more effective and efficient use of GPT in various aspects of my life and education. This enhancement in skill has been instrumental in achieving more satisfactory and quicker outputs.

In conclusion, this project underscored that generative AI, while powerful, is not a standalone solution. The optimal utilization of AI, as I learned, lies in its synergy with human knowledge and intervention. This realization somewhat alleviated my concerns about AI's rapid advancement and its societal implications. AI is a potent tool, but it is not the ultimate solution. Human interaction and input remain indispensable, a conclusion that highlights the significance of this project in the broader context of AI development and application.

## What's Next?
I intend on continuing this project going forward. As a midshipman at Vanderbilt’s Navy ROTC unit, I will commission as an Ensign in the United States Navy upon graduation. Writing FITREPs and Navy Achievement Medal write-ups will undoubtedly be a part of my future, so expanding the capabilities of NAAT will be prudent. As GPT and other generative AI technologies advance, I intend on expanding the scope of this project throughout the remainder of my time before commissioning in the United States Navy. By the time I commission (in roughly a year), this custom GPT can be increasingly capable. This project has demonstrated that generative AI has the capability to be impactful for military applications, and I intend to prove that by continuing to expand upon this project.
